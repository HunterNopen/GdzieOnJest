# **GdzieOnJest: Real-Time PKS Bus Monitoring Application**

## **Project Overview**

**GdzieOnJest** is a cutting-edge mobile application designed to revolutionize public transport accessibility and convenience for PKS bus passengers. By leveraging advanced IoT technologies and real-time data processing, our system bridges the gap between passengers and live bus tracking. The app provides accurate, up-to-the-minute information on bus locations, estimated arrival times, and route progress, empowering users to plan their journeys efficiently and reduce idle waiting times at bus stops.

The ecosystem integrates seamlessly with IoT-enabled GPS devices installed in buses, ensuring reliable data transmission to a centralized server. Passengers access this data via an intuitive mobile application, receiving a comprehensive view of nearby buses, their real-time locations, and ETAs.

**GdzieOnJest** enhances the overall commuting experience by offering an intelligent, user-centric interface designed to cater to the dynamic needs of modern urban transit systems.
